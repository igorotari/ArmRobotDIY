# Robotic Arm Project ü§ñ

Welcome to my **Robotic Arm Project**! This project demonstrates how I programmed a robotic arm using servos and an Arduino board to pick up and move objects between two locations in a loop. üöÄ

This project is a **Keyestudio 4DOF Robot Arm Kit for Arduino DIY**, designed and programmed to demonstrate the manipulation of a robotic arm using servo motors. The arm is controlled via a microcontroller and programmed to pick up objects, move them to different positions, and return to the starting point.

### Project Overview

As part of an assignment during my time at the enterprise **–°–ü–ö–ë –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ**, I developed this project to showcase automated robotic control. Using the **Arduino** platform, I wrote a program that enables the arm to pick up objects with a claw, transfer them to another location, and repeat this process endlessly.

### Materials Used
- **Arduino Uno** ‚Äì the microcontroller platform
- **Keyestudio 4DOF Robot Arm Kit**
- **Servo motors** ‚Äì used for controlling the arm's joints and claw(these was in the complect with Keyestudio 4DOF Robot Arm Kit)
- **Jumper wires and breadboard** ‚Äì for connecting the components(all these also was in the complect with Keyestudio 4DOF Robot Arm Kit)
- **Arduino IDE** ‚Äì software for programming the Arduino board [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Project Workflow

1. **Assembling the Arm:** I first put together the robotic arm kit, connecting the servos to the appropriate joints for full range of motion.
2. **Installing Arduino:** After downloading and installing the **Arduino IDE**, I connected the Arduino board to my computer.
3. **Wiring the Arm:** The servos were connected to the Arduino's pins, with power supplied from the board itself.
4. **Programming the Arm:** I wrote a custom Arduino sketch to control each servo motor. The code allows the arm to:
   - Open and close the claw
   - Rotate and lift the arm
   - Move to different positions and return to the starting point

The code is structured to control the robotic arm using simple loops and servo commands. Each servo motor moves based on predefined angles, allowing for precise control of the arm‚Äôs movements.

### üìú Summary
This project was a fun way to learn about servo motors and Arduino programming. I enjoyed figuring out how to coordinate the movements and make the robotic arm perform repetitive tasks like a real industrial robot!

Check out the code and may be give it a try)
